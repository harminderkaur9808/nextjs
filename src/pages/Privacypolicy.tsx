  <div className="page_mainContent__GBVwI">
 <p>Section effective as of January 1, 2024</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
 <p>We are required by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) to provide California residents with an explanation of how we collect, use, and share their Personal Information and of the rights and choices we offer to California residents with respect to that Personal Information. For purposes of this section,
  “Personal Information” has the meaning given in the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”).</p>   
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
 </div>
  <div>
 <p>CCPA defines personal information as information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked (directly or indirectly) with a particular consumer or household, such as a real name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, account name, social security number, driver's license number, license plate number, passport number, or other similar identifiers. Personal data can also include online or social media profile information. Personal data is not limited to a number or a physical document but can also be online identities, accounts, and other personal information. Personal information does not include publicly available information that is from federal,
state, or local government records, such as professional licenses and public real estate/property records.</p>   
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
  <p><b>Your California privacy rights.</b>The CCPA grants California residents the following rights. However, these rights are not absolute. In certain cases, we may decline your request as permitted by law.</p>   
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><b>Right to know.</b>You can request information about how we have collected, used,and shared your personal information during the past 12 months. The information contains the categories of personal information, specific pieces of personal information, the categories of sources from which the business collected personal information, the purposes for which the business uses the personal information, 
  the categories of third parties with whom the business shares the personal information, and the categories of information that the business sells or discloses to third parties.</p>   
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><b>Right to opt-out.</b>You may request us to stop selling your personal information (“opt-out”). Businesses cannot sell your personal information after receiving your opt-out request unless you later provide authorization allowing them to do so again. Businesses must wait at least 12 months before asking you to opt back into selling your personal information. However, if a sale is necessary for the business to comply with legal obligations, exercise legal claims or rights, or defend legal claims,
   or if the personal information is certain medical information, consumer credit reporting information, or other types of information exempt from the CCPA, the business can deny your opt-out request</p>   
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><b>Right to delete</b>You may request our service providers and us to delete your personal information except for the following reasons: (a) we cannot verify your request; (b) to complete your transaction, provide a reasonably anticipated product or service, 
  or for certain warranty and product recall purposes; (c) for certain business security practices; (d) for certain internal uses that are compatible with reasonable consumer expectations or the context in which the information was provided; (e) to comply with legal obligations, exercise legal claims or rights, or defend legal claims.</p>   
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><b>Right to non-discrimination.</b>You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination in the form of legally prohibited increases in the price or decreases in the quality of our Service.<br></br>We have provided additional information about how you can opt out of using your information for interest-based advertising in the “Your Choices” section of our Cookie Policy.</p>   
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><b>How to exercise your California rights.</b>You may exercise your California privacy rights described above as follows:</p> 
   <p>&nbsp;</p>  
 </div>
 
 <div>
  <p><b>Right to know, opt out and delete.</b>You can request to exercise your rights by emailing service@Example.com. We reserve the right to confirm your California residence to process your requests and will need to verify your identity to process your requests to exercise your rights to know, opt out, and delete your personal information. As part of this process, government identification may be required. Consistent with California law, you may designate an authorized agent to request on your behalf. To designate an authorized agent to request on your behalf, you must provide a valid power of attorney, the requester’s valid government-issued identification, and the authorized agent’s valid government-issued identification.
   We cannot process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to understand and respond to it.</p> 
   <p>&nbsp;</p>  
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><b>Request a list of third-party marketers.</b>California’s “Shine the Light” law (California Civil Code § 1798.83) allows California residents to ask companies with whom they have formed a business relationship primarily for personal, family, or household purposes to provide certain information about the companies’ sharing of certain personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding year (if any). You can submit such a request by sending an email to service@Example.com with “Shine the Light” in the subject line.
   The request must include your current name, street address, city, state, and zip code and attest that you are a California resident.</p>  
     <p>&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Other technologies</strong>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to cookies, our Sites may use other technologies, such as Flash technology and pixel tags, to collect information automatically.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Web Beacons</strong>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may also use web beacons (known as pixel tags and clear GIFs) on our Sites and in our HTML-formatted emails to track the actions of users on our Sites and interactions with our emails. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages or within HTML-formatted emails. Pixel tags are used to demonstrate that a webpage was accessed or that certain content was viewed, 
  typically to measure the success of our marketing campaigns or engagement with our emails and to compile statistics about usage of the Sites, so that we can manage our content more effectively.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <strong>Mobile Application Software Development Kits (SDKs)</strong>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our apps may use third-party software development kits (“SDKs”). An SDK is third-party computer code that may be used for a variety of purposes,
   including providing us with analytics regarding the use of our mobile applications, integrating with social media, adding features or functionality to our Apps, or facilitating online advertising. SDKs may enable third parties to collect information directly via our Apps.</p>
