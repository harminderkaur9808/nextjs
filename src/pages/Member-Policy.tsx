                <h3>III. How to use AP points?</h3>
                <p>A-Premium website points are independent and displayed on your account. Points cannot be cashed, transferred, sold, or used across accounts.<br />
                  100 points = $1, with a minimum value of 1 dollar for use. Points usage is limited to a proportion of the total amount payable for items in the order, after discounts. Refer to "AP VIP Levels and Rights Rules" for specific right rules. See "Get More Points" on your account for more information about points and its use.<br />
                  Points can be used to redeem benefits such as coupon codes, physical gifts, or shipping fee deductions in the member center of A-Premium. Check specific participation conditions, redemption rules, and other details on corresponding pages.</p>

                <h3>IV. AP Points expiration</h3>
                <p>AP Points do not expire and can remain in your account indefinitely.</p>

                <h3>V. AP points return rules</h3>
                <p><span>If cancel unpaid order, points will return to the account.</span><br />
                  <span>If cancel order before shipping, points will return to the account.</span><br />
                  <span>If refunded after shipping, points used in the order will be returned, but points earned by this order will be deducted. For partial refund, points returned based on a percentage of the refunded item price to the total order price.</span></p>

                <h3 id="levelRule">VI. Breach of contract</h3>
                <p style={{ marginBottom: '30px' }}><span>Breach of points rules or using improper means to obtain or use points may result in deduction of all or part of points. A-Premium may request the user to return the deducted amount or redeemed gifts/benefits. A-Premium has the final interpretation right.</span><br />
                  <span>Note: Starting from September 1, 2022, users meeting the points criteria can receive point gifts. Points won't be awarded retroactively before this date. The program is in a trial phase, and any issues will be announced on the website.</span></p>
